## String
String is a collection of alphabets, words or other characters.  
Python has a built-in string class named str. 
Python strings are "immutable" which means they cannot be changed after they are created.

## Variables
-> We use variables to stores data temporally in a computers memory.
-> A Python variable is a reserved memory location to store values.
-> variable in a python program gives data to the computer for processing.
-> Every value in Python has a datatype. Different data types in Python are Numbers, List, Tuple, Strings, Dictionary, etc.

1. The input() function allows user input. reads a line from the input (usually from the user), it returns string
2. int(),float(),bool(),str() build in functions.
